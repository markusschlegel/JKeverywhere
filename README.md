# JKeverywhere – J/K-navigation on your site

I was frustrated and then I created this.

## Instructions

1. Open jkeverywhere.js and alter the value of the "jumpersQuery" variable to something like ".myAwesomeElementsThatIWantToBeJumpingDestinations"
2. Get that file be included, man!
3. ...
4. Profit!

## Stuff

Originally I wanted this thing to be a Chrome extension so you can easily navigate with j and k everywhere you like. Strangely when I bake this .js into a simple extension, it won’t work anymore. Chrome 12 on the Mac was fine, but Chrome 12 on Windows did strange things. Then I changed nothing and all of a sudden it was the other way round. I would be glad if someone could give me a hint on that.
